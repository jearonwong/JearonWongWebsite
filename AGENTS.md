# Repository Operating Rules for Codex

This repository is part of the Coregentis MPLP / Cognitive OS / SoloCrew / Validation Lab project family. Codex work here must preserve project boundaries and produce verifiable engineering evidence.

## Repository Layer

JearonWong.com owns articles, essays, white papers, brand narrative, publication pages, and social distribution assets. Public writing may claim conceptual positioning, but it must not overstate certification, legal compliance, regulator approval, vendor ranking, or official-standard status.

## Repo Truth First

Before implementation, inspect repository truth:

- `git branch --show-current`
- `git status --short`
- `git rev-parse HEAD`
- `git rev-parse --verify origin/main || true`
- `git log --oneline -5`

Reuse existing assets before creating new files. Prefer updating an existing rule, skill, script, audit, or governance record over creating a duplicate document.

## Hard Boundaries

- Preserve protocol, runtime, product, validation, and publication boundaries.
- Do not modify release tags, release seals, package versions, publish plans, public website copy, schemas/v2 protocol objects, core package implementation logic, product source code, Validation Lab runtime/evidence logic, or public legal/compliance claims unless the owner explicitly approves that scope.
- Do not run `npm publish`, `npm deprecate`, PyPI upload, PyPI yank/delete, `git tag`, release seal creation, package version bump, or protocol schema primitive intake without owner approval.
- Do not make public legal, compliance, certification, regulator-approval, vendor-ranking, or official-standard claims without owner approval.

## MPLP Schema v2 Discipline

For MPLP `schemas/v2` work, use this order:

1. Invariant first.
2. Negative fixture second.
3. Object schema third.
4. Positive fixture fourth.
5. Validator and conformance gates last.

v1.0 module references to v2 objects must be pointer-only. Do not inline v2 object fields into v1 module schemas.

## Boundary Language

- No product, runtime, commercial, certification, legal-compliance, regulator-approval, or vendor-ranking language may leak into MPLP protocol core.
- No protocol authority may leak into product UI.
- Cognitive OS may bind to MPLP semantics but must not redefine MPLP protocol authority.
- Validation Lab may present deterministic evidence and adjudication but must not become a certification authority.
- SoloCrew UI must not expose internal protocol/runtime jargon as primary user-facing copy.

## Completion Discipline

Do not declare completion without reporting:

- files changed
- commands run
- pass/fail evidence
- final git status
- remaining risk

If a verification command is unavailable or inappropriate, state why instead of silently skipping it.
